# PCABM

This is the sample code for finding the optimal way to weight multi-layer networks.

Simulations.ipynb include two toy examples, respectively for planted-partition model and stochastic block model, to illustrate how to run different algorithms.

Followings are introductions to pcabm's files:

- commFunc.py : some common functions that will be used often.
- multi.py     : algorithms for multi-layer networks
